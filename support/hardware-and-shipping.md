## Shipping Delays

From the moment we first opened the store in December, we expected we would need until late spring or early summer 2022 to begin shipping devices.&#x20;

Admittedly, we've seen some delays, and we've written about those at length. The highlights to know are:

* More inventory will arrive the first week of August and we will begin fulfilling orders almost immediately.
* Inventory deliveries will ramp up significantly throughout the remainder of the year, and we may even be able to catch up to our original timelines.&#x20;

## Other Shipping FAQs

### When will the store reopen?

We are aiming to re-open the store in September 2022. Preference will be provided to users who have joined the waitlist aka have added a car to DIMO via the Mobile App. This means we will likely offer at least one wave of ordering to users who have added vehicles before opening up more broadly.

### Can I buy someone else's device if they return it?

Since we're providing preference to users based on when they added their car to DIMO, we are not facilitating people claiming returned devices out of turn.

### Can I sell my device to someone else?

We do not officially endorse this. DIMO is still an early stage project, and we cannot guarantee a seamless experience when devices are bought or sold on the open market, even if that activity is in good faith.&#x20;

Not that not all actors operate with the best intentions. We expect to see scammers and encourage everyone to do your own research. Your best bet to get your hands on a DIMO device is to wait on availability at the official DIMO store ([<mark style="color:blue;">shop.dimo.zone</mark>](https://shop.dimo.zone/))

### Want to join the waitlist?

Add your car in the [DIMO Mobile App](https://onelink.to/dimo/?utm\_source=customer\_io\&utm\_medium=newsletter\&utm\_campaign=the\_movement). Adding your car puts in in line for ordering.&#x20;
