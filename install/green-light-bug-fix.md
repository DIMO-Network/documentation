| Go ahead and select that network and use the included password that was provided over email.

Step 3: Patch into the AutoPi. Open your internet browser and type in the URL 192.168.4.1 to connect directly to the AutoPi. You should see a splash screen and can hit “Login”

Step 4: Click the LTE tab. You will see 4 tabs on this page, Device, 4G/lLTE, WIFI, and Terminal.

Click on the 4G/LTE tab

(Note that the 4G icon will show as black, This will turn green after a successful connection)

Step 5: Set the APN and save. There is a field called “APN string.” Type the word “super” exactly as it’s shown here. Press the Save button.

It will reboot the 4G connection and come back with a Green checkmark when it has rebooted successfully.

Step 6. Verification

After your device has successfully rebooted, Check to make sure the flashing green light is now solid. It may take up to 10 minutes after a fresh reboot for the SIM to configure itself to the closest cell tower.

The stronger the cell coverage, the faster it will connect.

If you log into 192.168.4.1 and see all green at the top then you are connected

Step 7. Updating Your device will update automatically the next time you shut off of your vehicle. It will rapidly flash green during the update process. This can take up to 10 minutes. You can turn off your vehicle and do something else during this time.

Error Checking - If you see this error, just refresh the page to see if the apn string has been set to super.
