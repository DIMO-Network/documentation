### Getting Help from a Person

* Run into problems? Email support@dimo.zone or come to Discord.
* Do you want to book a time to speak with someone? [<mark style="color:blue;">Book a time</mark>](https://calendly.com/d/drm-89h-kbx/install-support-call?month=2022-05).

### Warnings

* You're early! The install process may not be perfect and there may be some kinks to iron out.
* Do not put this device on an airbag panel.

### Other things to Know

* **How the AutoPi Operates.** Once the AutoPi is plugged in it will power on/off automatically. The device automatically hibernates at 12.4 volts, and shuts off at 12.3 volts to protect your battery. It will update its own software automatically when we push new updates.&#x20;
* **Lights on the AutoPi**. The lights on the AutoPi may stay on or flash when you shut your vehicle off, but this will not kill your battery. It‚Äôs just temporary and the AutoPi will hibernate.
* **Unusual Occurrences**. If you notice anything unusual after plugging in your device like a check engine light, we want to hear from you. Between AutoPi and DIMO, there are thousands of devices in the field, and we're confident this will not impact your vehicle operations, but we can help troubleshoot and make sure everything is normal and alarms clear.&#x20;
* **How the device works.** We won't cover that here, but if you'd like to learn more, [<mark style="color:blue;">click here</mark>](https://blog.dimo.zone/understanding-your-dimo-miner-and-its-data/)<mark style="color:blue;">.</mark>
* **What cars can connect**? We only support vehicles 10 years old and newer.&#x20;

### **3.1: Locate Your OBD2 Port**&#x20;

This specialized data port is usually under the dashboard below the steering wheel, but you may find it in a few other locations depending on your car. Refer to this picture for areas on where the port might be: <img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (4) (1).png" alt="" data-size="line"> (click to expand)\
\
The port may be hard to find in some vehicles, but you should see a trapezoid shape with two rows of pins that looks like this: <img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (11).png" alt="" data-size="line"> (click to expand)

{% hint style="info" %}
If your port is hard to find. you can click <mark style="color:blue;"></mark> [<mark style="color:blue;">here</mark>](https://www.carmd.com/obd-port-location/) for help.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

### **3.2: Select a Device Location with your Extension Cable**

{% hint style="info" %}
You may want to complete the process of mounting the device until after the completing the pairing as you will need to be able to scan the barcode and check the lights on the device. &#x20;
{% endhint %}

After locating your OBD2 port, you may want to sit in the drivers seat to find your ideal mounting location. &#x20;

We recommended the following options for places to install your DIMO Device. It's up to you where you would like to place it:

_Click the pictures to see them full size._

* Attach to vehicle trim below steering column
* Attach directly to dashboard (not ideal in hotter climates with direct sunlight)
* Route under the floor mat and store in rear seat pocket
* Store inside vehicle trim (may require some removal/replacement)

{% hint style="danger" %}
Plugging in your DIMO device directly to your OBD2 may result in a loose connection. This may cause issues with data accuracy, engine lights, or detachment from the OBD2 port. \
\
**We recommend you use an extension cable.** If the one supplied is not a suitable length, you can order an OBD2 cable of a different length on many sites, including Amazon.
{% endhint %}

**You can come back here after the Mobile App Pairing Process.** Once you have found your ideal location for mounting, wipe the area down with the included alcohol wipe. Attach the included Velcro or 3M tape to the device. Attach one end of the extension cable to the device and then plug in the other side into your OBD-2 port. Mount the device to your vehicle.&#x20;
