### Getting Help from a Person

* Run into problems? Email support@dimo.zone or come to Discord.

### Warnings

* You're early! The install process may not be perfect and there may be some kinks to iron out.
* Do not put this device on an airbag panel.
* What else?

### Other things to Know

* **How the AutoPi Operates.** Once the AutoPi is plugged in it will power on/off automatically. The device automatically hibernates at 12.4 volts, and shuts off at 12.3 volts to protect your battery. It will update its own software automatically when we push new updates.&#x20;
* **Lights on the AutoPi**. The lights on the AutoPi may stay on or flash when you shut your vehicle off, but this will not kill your battery. It‚Äôs just temporary and the AutoPi will hibernate.
* **Unusual Occurrences**. If you notice anything unusual after plugging in your device like a check engine light, we want to hear from you. Between AutoPi and DIMO, there are thousands of devices in the field, and we're confident this will not impact your vehicle operations, but we can help troubleshoot and make sure everything is normal and alarms clear.&#x20;
* **How the device works.** We won't cover that here, but if you'd like to learn more, [click here](https://blog.dimo.zone/understanding-your-dimo-miner-and-its-data/).

## Step 3: Install the Device and Pair in the DIMO Mobile App

1. [Locate Your OBD2 Port](whats-included.md#1-locate-the-obd2-port)
2. [Select a Device Location with your Extension Cable](whats-included.md#2-select-a-device-location-with-your-extension-cable)

4. [Secure the Device](whats-included.md#4-secure-the-device)

### **1) Locate Your OBD2 Port**&#x20;

This specialized data port is usually under the dashboard below the steering wheel, but you may find it in a few other locations depending on your car. Refer to this picture for areas on where the port might be: <img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (4).png" alt="" data-size="line"> (click to expand)\

The port may be hard to find in some vehicles, but you should see a trapezoid shape with two rows of pins that looks like this: <img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (11).png" alt="" data-size="line"> (click to expand)

{% hint style="info" %}
If your port is hard to find. you can click [here](https://www.carmd.com/obd-port-location/) for help.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

### **2) Select a Device Location with your Extension Cable**

After locating your port, you may want to sit in the drivers seat to find your ideal mounting location. &#x20;

We recommended the following options for places to install your DIMO Device:

1. Attach to vehicle trim below steering column
2. Attach directly to dashboard (not ideal in hotter climates with direct sunlight)
3. Route under the floor mat and store in rear seat pocket
4. Store inside vehicle trim (may require some removal/replacement)

{% hint style="danger" %}
Plugging in your DIMO device directly may result in a loose connection. This may cause the issues with the device in reported data correctly. We **recommend** the use of the included extension cord to install the device.
{% endhint %}

### 3) Pairing Process in the DIMO Mobile app.&#x20;
