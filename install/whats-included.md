## Before you Start: üö®Warnings and ‚ö†Ô∏èKey Info

You're early! The install process may not be perfect and there may be some kinks to iron out.

Do not put this device on an airbag panel.

Once the AutoPi is plugged in it will power on/off automatically, (sometimes you will need to start your vehicle). The device automatically hibernates at 12.4 volts, and shuts off at 12.3 volts. You may see lights flashing when you shut your vehicle off, but this will not kill your battery. It‚Äôs just temporary.

‚úÖ All good? Let's get going.&#x20;

## Step 1: Check the Contents of Your Package

In the box you should have received the following items:

* **DIMO Miner** (SIM card is already installed and active)
* **OBD2 extension cord** for the DIMO Miner to find a comfortable mounting position
* **Alcohol swab** (for cleaning the area that you will mount your device)
* **Velcro / 3M Adhesive Tape** (for mounting the device to a safe space in your car)
* **Informational card** with QR codes that link to: (1) the DIMO Mobile App and (2) these instructions here
* **DIMO Stickers** just for fun!

If you think anything is broken, defective or missing, please email support@dimo.zone. We can help you evaluate and if necessary get you a packing/return slip, as this will not be included in the package.

‚úÖ If everything looks good, let's move on to the next step!

## Step 3: Watch the Installation Video

(in final review, coming soon)



‚úÖ Got all that? You can read through it all below:

## Step 3: Review these Instructions

1. Locate your OBD2 port
2. Select a Device Location with your Extension Cable
3. Follow the Pairing Process in the DIMO Mobile app
4. Secure the Device

### **1) Locate the OBD2 Port**&#x20;

This specialized data port is usually under the dashboard below the steering wheel, but you may find it in a few other locations depending on your car. The port can be hard to find in some vehicles, but you should see a trapezoid shape with two rows of pins that looks like this:

### **2) Select a Device Location with your Extension Cable**

**You'll want to select a mounting location, but it's probably easier to go through the pairing process in the app before you finish mounting the device.**

Depending on where your OBD2 port is, if you install the AutoPi directly into it, it can be in the way when you drive. **Most people will need to use the extension cord to install the device in a place where it will not be in the way.**&#x20;

{% hint style="warning" %}
You may want to experiment with a few locations by sitting in your driver's seat with the device plugged in. You can try it with the extension cord, or without.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

We recommended the following options for places to install your AutoPi Device:

1. Attach to vehicle trim below steering column
2. Attach directly to dashboard (not ideal in hotter climates with direct sunlight)
3. Route under the floor mat and store in rear seat pocket
4. Store inside vehicle trim (may require some removal/replacement)

### 3) Follow the Pairing Process in the DIMO Mobile app.&#x20;

{% hint style="success" %}
You will need to download the DIMO mobile app to start your pairing process with your new device. You can download the IOS app [here](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/dimo-mobile/id1589486727) and the Android app [here](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.dimo.driver).&#x20;

{% endhint %}

**5.)** Locate the barcode on the left side of your DIMO device, and select "Scan my barcode" in the mobile app. Proceed to scan the barcode on your device, you will see a checkmark if it has successfully scanned.&#x20;

{% hint style="warning" %}

{% endhint %}

**6.)** Plug in your DIMO Miner into the OBD-II port in your vehicle and start your vehicles ignition. Wait for your device to boot up and show both a solid green and blue light. Once you have verified both lights are on select ‚ÄúI‚Äôm plugged in‚Äù to continue.&#x20;

**7.)** Congratulations! You now have your vehicle connected with DIMO! Take your car out for a drive and watch all the data flow in.&#x20;

### **4) Secure the Device**

Once you‚Äôve found the ideal location for the device, first use the provided alcohol swab to wipe down the area, then use the provided double-sided tape to secure the AutoPi in the swabbed area

****

The AutoPi Miner then connects via 4G and configures itself for your vehicle. This may take up to 15 minutes, and you may need to drive around if you‚Äôre in an area with poor cell coverage.
