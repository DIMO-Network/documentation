## Step 3: Watch the Installation Video

âœ… Got all that? You can read through it all below:

## Step 3: Review the Instructions

1. Locate your OBD2 port
2. Select a Device Location with your Extension Cable
3. Follow the Pairing Process in the DIMO Mobile app.&#x20;

### **1) Locate the OBD2 Port**&#x20;

This specialized data port is usually under the dashboard below the steering wheel, but you may find it in a few other locations depending on your car. The port can be hard to find in some vehicles, but you should see a trapezoid shape with two rows of pins that looks like this:

If you need help finding it, click [here](https://www.carmd.com/obd-port-location/). You may have to check a few places to find the port.

### **2) Select a Device Location with your Extension Cable**

**You'll want to select a mounting location, but it's probably easier to go through the pairing process in the app before you finish mounting the device.**

Depending on where your OBD2 port is, if you install the AutoPi directly into it, it can be in the way when you drive. **Most people will need to use the extension cord to install the device in a place where it will not be in the way.**&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
You may want to experiment with a few locations by sitting in your driver's seat with the device plugged in. You can try it with the extension cord, or without.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

We recommended the following options for places to install your AutoPi Device:

1. Attach to vehicle trim below steering column
2. Attach directly to dashboard (not ideal in hotter climates with direct sunlight)
3. Route under the floor mat and store in rear seat pocket
4. Store inside vehicle trim (may require some removal/replacement)



### 3) Follow the Pairing Process in the DIMO Mobile app.&#x20;

Once youâ€™ve found the ideal location for the device, first use the provided alcohol swab to wipe down the area, then use the provided double-sided tape to secure the AutoPi in the swabbed area

### ****

\
Once the AutoPi is plugged in it will power on/off automatically, (sometimes you will need to start your vehicle). The device automatically hibernates at 12.4 volts, and shuts off at 12.3 volts. You may see lights flashing when you shut your vehicle off, but this will not kill your battery. Itâ€™s just temporary.\
\
The AutoPi Miner then connects via 4G and configures itself for your vehicle. This may take up to 15 minutes, and you may need to drive around if youâ€™re in an area with poor cell coverage.
