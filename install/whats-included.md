âœ… Got all that? You can read through it all below:

## Step 3: Review the Instructions

1. Find your OBD2 port
2. Determine where you will mount your device
3. Follow the Pairing Process in the app.&#x20;

### **1) Locate the OBD2 Port**&#x20;

This specialized data port is usually under the dashboard below the steering wheel, but you may find it in a few other locations depending on your car. The port can be hard to find in some vehicles, but you should see a trapezoid shape with two rows of pins that looks like this:

### **2) Select a Device Location**&#x20;

Depending on where your OBD2 port is, if you install the AutoPi directly into it, it can be in the way when you drive. **Most people will need to use the extension cord to install the device in a place where it will not be in the way.**

The extension cord will allow you to get the device to a secure, and out of sight location. Do not put this device on an airbag panel.

We recommended the following options for places to install your AutoPi Device:

1. Attach to vehicle trim below steering column
2. Attach directly to dashboard (not ideal in hotter climates with direct sunlight)
3. Route under the floor mat and store in rear seat pocket
4. Store inside vehicle trim (may require some removal/replacement)\


Once youâ€™ve found the ideal location for the device, first use the provided alcohol swab to wipe down the area, then use the provided double-sided tape to secure the AutoPi in the swabbed area

### **Using An Extension Cable** <img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/OobmyiHmijqx68U94nmsBv8JynlctzXKAHaWHJkajEbEhFkcNa0z61v7_3h73cIkULB_2bp85ZIvL-NOJtBJ1iT7uL5hE8n7-d40PCz3tIo7_KVl4l4vBW6NMg5GCLmYyKP3d3r-qnesiPraGA" alt="" data-size="line">

\
Once the AutoPi is plugged in it will power on/off automatically, (sometimes you will need to start your vehicle). The device automatically hibernates at 12.4 volts, and shuts off at 12.3 volts. You may see lights flashing when you shut your vehicle off, but this will not kill your battery. Itâ€™s just temporary.\
\
The AutoPi Miner then connects via 4G and configures itself for your vehicle. This may take up to 15 minutes, and you may need to drive around if youâ€™re in an area with poor cell coverage.
