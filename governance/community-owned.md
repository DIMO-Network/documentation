# Community Owned

### Why DIMO must be a decentralized community owned protocol

DIMO aims to be a reliable, secure, and user-aligned base layer for connected devices. We believe the only way to credibly achieve these goals is to build DIMO as an open source platform where control is vested in a diverse collection of users and stakeholders who all have skin in the game.

Not convinced? Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and Google are platforms. Are their incentives aligned with their users or will [they make you miserable](https://techmonitor.ai/techonology/facebook-makes-users-envious-dissatisfied-study-220113) if it means you’ll spend more time on their site? Is it a fair platform to build your app on, or will they [extort you](https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/report-zynga-and-facebook-relationship-at-breaking-point) when you become successful? Who controls [access and censorship](https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/twitter-keeps-riding-line-between-moderation-censorship-n1273434)? Do you control your data or [do they](https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/google-sells-future-powered-your-personal-data-n870501)?

We don’t necessarily blame Facebook. We blame the incentives that Web 2.0 business models systematically create. DIMO’s vision is bigger than this—it’s to create a reality where user-owned digital ecosystems are the norm. We simply need a better model.

We also want DIMO to scale and grow its offering quickly and effectively. By reducing friction and bureaucracy, opening up DIMO to global contributors, creating an operating structure that can scale, and aligning all stakeholders around the $DIMO token, the DIMO platform and the apps on top of it will be built far better and way faster.

### DIMO Will Be Run as a Foundation (DAO)

Digital Infrastructure Inc, and other early partners responsible for building the IP behind DIMO will shift control of the project to a foundation (which we'll refer to as DIMO). Our intent is to operate this entity as a Decentralized Autonomous Organization ("DAO") where holders of the $DIMO token can generate and vote on proposals that control DIMO. There are no self-imposed restrictions on what the DIMO community is able to vote on and do. We expect that some of the key activities of the DIMO foundation will include:&#x20;

1. Designing, deploying, and adjusting rewards pools for drivers and referral bonus programs;
2. Allocating authority and resources to subDAOs (called dTeams) and individuals via [streams](https://www.superfluid.finance/home), grants, and bounties. This may fund work such as: building the decentralized data storage infrastructure; determining the optimal method by which vehicle data will be priced and sold; building applications on top of DIMO; and [DBC decoding](https://docs.google.com/document/u/0/d/1i8XxRadq2Bta5hJDSOD4oXO\_q63xtuaE6cxzpSKB7e4/edit) to expand the number of supported vehicles;
3. Whitelisting third-party hardware suppliers who build [the devices ](https://www.autopi.io/hardware-dongle/generation-three/) that sign and stream data; and&#x20;
4. Investing the treasury.

### Foundation Design

The designs of different DAOs in the industry vary widely. DIMO’s initial structure aims to maximize practicality and efficiency without compromising decentralization, alignment, and security. On the spectrum of DAOs that, on one side are completely flat and vote on everything at the DAO level to DAOs that, on the other side rely on stewards, subDAOs, and delegation to simplify operations, we'll skew towards the latter.

We’ll seed the initial structure of DIMO so that it will:&#x20;

1. Make it natural and easy for token holders to delegate their voting power to stewards if the don’t have the time or context to vote themselves (similar to [Gitcoin](https://gitcoin.co/quadraticlands/faq#5) and [ENS](https://ens.mirror.xyz/cfvfKRpQSPtZJjPQOprWqEeqv2rytE7tQkxDg6ht7Oo));
2. Establish special responsibilities for the stewards who reach a certain threshold of delegated voting power (similar to [Element and their GSC](https://medium.com/element-finance/an-introduction-to-elements-governance-model-efea13d1c7ee));
3. Delegate authority and resources so that work can get done faster in dTeams (similar to [Yearn and their yTeams](https://gov.yearn.finance/t/yip-61-governance-2-0/10460));
4. Utilize a proposal documentation and review structure (similar to the one [robsolomon.eth](https://self.id/did:3:kjzl6cwe1jw1463qefnsg4pdqdyb7pypflty6p6uhp7kqlvdc37ba3uk21umwtw) [designed at ConsenSys](https://corporate-rebels.com/annual-planning-investing-beats-budgeting/)) for defining the plans, needs, and risks of dTeams;
5. Introduce time delays before voting execution to allow users and the DAO to exit or intervene (similar to [Compound](https://compound.finance/docs/governance#timelock));
6. Utilize best in class tools such as [Open Zeppelin Governor](https://blog.openzeppelin.com/governor-smart-contract/), [Collab.Land](https://collab.land), [Snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/), [Tally](https://www.withtally.com), and more to organize transparent and programmatic collaboration; and
7. Operate as an offshore non-profit foundation to limit liability for DAO participants, simplify tax compliance, and execute contracts in the physical world. Such foundations tend to have administrative costs between $30,000 and $50,000 per year, which would need to be paid out of the DAO's treasury.&#x20;

After it’s launched, DIMO foundation will be responsible for upgrading itself and tweaking this structure. We’re paying attention to the ideas expressed by [Vitalik](https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/08/16/voting3.html), Element, and others on improving voting— when feasible, we expect to implement voting vaults, hybrid NFT/$DIMO voting, and quadratic voting.&#x20;

Our team also considers the unique and existing governance processes around mobility that we’ll need to interact with. Everything from a 100-year-old automaker to a state DMV will need to interact with our platform, and **we’re respectful of the fact that transportation is already quite decentralized.**

Our vision is to build a community of people who can reshape mobility - the physical act of moving people and goods around. This is a different challenge than building purely digital projects, and if successful, we will help bring many millions more people into the web3 world.&#x20;
