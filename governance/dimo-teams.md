# DIMO Teams

To optimize for effectiveness, alignment, and scalability, we will delegate authority and responsibility broadly; operate with full transparency; use token-based staking, credentialing, and contingent funding systems; and use proactive performance monitoring.

It’s not reasonable to expect voters and even stewards to get into the weeds and vote frequently on small ad hoc decisions. Proposals voted on by the community will most often be proposals to delegate resources and authority to a DIMO Team. These are specialized teams that the DAO votes to give resources and/or authority to in order to fulfill a specific purpose. They're like a department or team in a traditional company. In other DAOs, they're often called a guild or subDAO.

We’ll have DIMO Teams focused on building decentralized data storage architectures, tweaking token incentives, producing content, designing the mobile app, and more. Some may appoint a leader, some may operate using [Teal principles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teal\_organisation), and others might even go as far as to operate as their own DAO, maybe even with their own governance tokens.

### How a DIMO Team is formed and funded

The simplest way a new team can get started is to receive a small grant from dStewards for research and pro-typing, get hired by another team that already has funding, or to forgo funding altogether. For others, the following describes how to get funding and authority directly from DIMO.

The DIMO community will fund DIMO Teams like an investor funding a startup. This means that teams will present what they do, make an ask, negotiate funding and deliverables, and unlock tranches of resources based on hitting agreed upon milestones. Here's how it works:

### **1**

A DIMO Team will emerge to accomplish a given purpose (e.g., to write DIMO content to raise awareness). Anyone can form a team, but it will require the support of 10,000,000 $DIMO worth of voting power (1% of tokens) to formally initiate the DIMO Team Funding Process. Once that threshold is cleared, the applicant will coordinate with dStewards to schedule their pitch to the community.

### 2

This Team will prepare a written proposal as well as a slide presentation covering their: purpose and mission; realistic operating goals; execution plan; financial plan; key risks; team composition and qualifications; team governance structure (how they make decisions); process for onboarding and offboarding contributors; funding request; and their request for specific authority if applicable (e.g., Hardware may request the power to whitelist new hardware miners). It’s recommended that they seek guidance and feedback from at least a couple of stewards.

### 3

On a dedicated community call, the team will take one hour to deliver the presentation and another hour to answer questions. During the Q\&A, stewards will be invited to ask questions live on the call while anyone else may submit questions via [Sli.do](https://www.sli.do), which will be asked in the order of most upvoted. The meeting itself will be recorded and posted for anyone who wants to watch later.

### 4

Everyone, especially stewards, are welcome to provide feedback openly to the petitioning dTeam. dStewards will work with the team to incorporate feedback and publish a proposed coordination contract in [Discourse](https://www.discourse.org) where community members can continue to deliberate.

A template coordination contract is viewable [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1\_WDW4hgifzary105kXAsRpDBqY6q3lU1uoy9F5gdc8k/edit?usp=sharing). This document will define:

**Scope**: Outlining the high-level purpose of what the Team team exists to accomplish;

**Funding terms**: Including amounts and conditions (such as timelines or development milestones);

**Operating commitments**: For example, dSupport committing to providing 24/7 customer support;

**Cultural commitments**: Clarifying how the Team must act within DIMO (e.g., participate in specific community calls and treat everyone with respect and kindness);

**Reporting commitments**: Laying out what regular reporting the Team must provide weekly, monthly, and/or quarterly as applicable (e.g., financial detail, site uptime, support tickets, app changelogs);

**Authority & domain**: Detailing what unique powers and rights the Team has; and

**Oversight**: Detailing how the team is to be held accountable (more on this in #6 below).

### 5

After one week of open deliberation, a vote will go live whereby $DIMO holders are able to vote. These votes will be conducted on [Snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/dimo.eth) with a seven day voting window.

### 6

If the vote passes, the Team is then managed and evaluated per the oversight conditions set forth in the agreement. Similar to the way a venture fund checks-in with portfolio companies, an analyst is appointed by dStewards to periodically consolidate all reporting materials, build scorecards detailing how the team did in meeting their various commitments, and conduct reviews with the team to dig deeper into the subjective measures of performance. These outputs will be shared with the community.\
