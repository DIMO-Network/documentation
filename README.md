# What is DIMO

DIMO is an open platform that connects data **producers** (like cars) and **consumers** (applications and businesses) to unlock next generation mobility services.&#x20;

**Vehicle owners** use DIMO to save money and get more out of their mobility spend. The platform allows them to collect, use and monetize the data their cars generate.&#x20;

**Businesses & App developers** can access vehicle data to build services on a stable, open platform - reducing the cost of building integrations and allowing them to focus on delivering value to users.

DIMO will be built in the open with open source components. This approach will unlock levels of transparency, privacy, composability, and reliability in IoT networks - increasing user and developer trust in connected devices and services.
