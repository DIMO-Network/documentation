# What is $DIMO

$DIMO is an ERC-20 token on the Ethereum blockchain with a 1,000,000,000 token supply. It is currently being held in a multi-signature wallet controlled by the DIMO core team prior to the public launch.

While we're still developing the token, weâ€™re building it to be useful in a handful of ways, including:

#### Payment & Rewards

$DIMO will be the sole token exchanged to access data, as well as the sole token to reward drivers who connect their vehicles and stream data to the protocol. Check out the next page to read about rewards design.

Being sensitive to the fact that many end consumers may not be interested in acquiring and holding $DIMO, we will make use of Data Unions (brokers) that such end consumers (e.g., Geico, Waze, Vroom, JD Power) can transact using traditional service contracts and fiat money.

#### Governance

DIMO (the platform) is open source and transparently operated, meaning the discussions and finances are transparent. $DIMO holders are voters, and voters control DIMO. To learn more about governance, check out our section [ðŸ—³ Governance](../governance/community-owned.md).

#### Staking&#x20;

When data consumers and app developers agree to DIMOâ€™s terms of service, theyâ€™ll put up a deposit (their stake) of $DIMO that can be taken away (slashed) if they misuse user data. This keeps dispute resolution simple, transparent, and out of the courts. The more data they consume, the more $DIMO theyâ€™ll need to stake. This has the added benefit of aligning them with DIMO as theyâ€™ll need to own more $DIMO tokens to get access to additional data, and users stand to be compensated more if their privacy is compromised.

#### Enhanced Access

DIMO users and app developers get access to features (e.g., enhanced vehicle diagnostics, events, NFT drops, API privileges, and more) based on $DIMO token holdings.
