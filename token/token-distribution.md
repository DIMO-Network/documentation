# Token Distribution

![Chart depicting approximately when tokens will unlock for various token pools](<../.gitbook/assets/token unlock@2x (1).png>)

The total supply of 1,000,000,000 $DIMO will be allocated in a manner that lines up with industry average allocations for protocol rewards, the DAO treasury, the core team, and capital partners. A community-first approach is important, which is why we’re allocating an above average 70% of tokens to users and the treasury.

### The DAO Treasury

700,000,000 $DIMO will be initially allocated to the community controlled DAO treasury. While no topics are off limits for community governance, the DAO’s $DIMO supply will take over 8 years for 80% to fully unlock.

Teams and individuals that contribute work to the DAO will receive $DIMO (and/or other cryptocurrency that the treasury accumulates) in the form of bounties or grants. However, the way most users will earn tokens is through driver rewards.&#x20;

### Driver Rewards

In the first DIMO Improvement Proposal (DIP), the community will vote to earmark a majority of the 700,000,000 $DIMO treasury to a token pool that will incentivize drivers into the future based on Baseline Demand Signal (as described in [Demand Signal](drive-to-earn.md)), as well as airdrop tokens to early users who connected their vehicles prior to the launch of $DIMO. This proposal would establish the total number of tokens in the pool (likely 450,000,000 $DIMO), the distribution of an airdrop, and the schedule and mechanics for issuing them going forward.

### DIMO Core Team & Capital Partners&#x20;

The remaining 300,000,000 $DIMO will be allocated to DIMO founders and employees (expected to be roughly 225,000,000) and capital partners who have invested in DIMO (expected to be roughly 75,000,000). This is meant both to reflect the time, risk, and capital that went into building the current software, launching $DIMO, and seeding the DAO. It is subject to lockups and vesting to incentivize the team as we contribute to the development of the DIMO platform for many years to come.

The DIMO founders and employees may receive a small portion locked for two years—plus their main allocation which will be subject to a four year vesting schedule, requiring continuous service to the DAO.

Capital partners will be subject to a two year lockup where, after those two years, 1/12th of their tokens start unlocking each month for a year. In other words, after two years, they’ll unlock 8.33% of their tokens per month.

The DIMO team and capital partners will both have full voting control of their locked and/or unvested tokens on day one, but will be encouraged to delegate a significant portion of that voting control to community stewards.
