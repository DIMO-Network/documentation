# üèé Open Vehicle ID

{% hint style="info" %}
Coming soon - currently in closed Alpha testing&#x20;
{% endhint %}

DIMO unlocks a digital story of a vehicle‚Äôs life by creating an on-chain open vehicle ID (aka NFT) of their car. This digital asset will represent ownership over the data from their vehicle. &#x20;

As vehicle data is sent to the DIMO network, it is linked as vehicle lifecycle history. Not just a url to a jpeg of your vehicle, it‚Äôs your key to ownership records and selected driving data.

At any point in time, the owner of the asset can access the vehicle's data, analyze , delegate or grant access to a 3rd party for users like insurance, accident reconstruction, carsharing, pre-sale inspection, and more.&#x20;

### What data does a DIMO enabled Open Vehicle ID Contain?

Here's what is included in the default configuration:&#x20;

**Car Photo or user skin:** Made with the composer in the DIMO app.&#x20;

**Partial VIN:** While DIMO NFTs do not use a UUID or VIN as primary key, it can be partially added to the NFT at the user's discretion.&#x20;

**Place of Manufacture:** Reported to NHTSA **** from the OEM&#x20;

As an open and extensible building block, further data can be attached over time.&#x20;

### Future Data Types & Uses&#x20;

**Proof of Movement Data -** Autopi, SmartCar&#x20;

**DIMO Validated Credentials -** Insurance Policies, Title, Registration&#x20;

**Price -** While you can't transfter the NFT today, our goal is to allow you tosell your vehicle data history with any normal vehicle transaction. DIMO's core team is working on escrow and transfer contracts to make this easy and privacy preserving.&#x20;
