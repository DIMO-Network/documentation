# How DIMO scales

DIMO is designed to use both mission and financial alignment to achieve project goals of building a safer, zero emission future. As with all projects, gaining initial momentum requires additional force to overcome inertia.

Rewarding early adopters and offering referral bonuses is not a new idea. Venture funding subsidized discounted rates and credits as Uber and Lyft grew throughout the 2010’s. While this has been proven an effective strategy for breaking into a market, it doesn’t generate long-term alignment and grass roots community alignment with a platform. Projects like Helium have demonstrated a capital efficient method of bootstrapping user-owned IoT infrastructure past 250,000+ nodes (and counting) in two years.

DIMO is designed around a similar feedback loop, adding additional support at key leverage points to accelerate adoption and benefits to users:

Ranked by priority, our focus during the bootstrapping phase will be:&#x20;

1. Build vehicle supply through $DIMO token issuance to early data providers.
2. Incentivize OEMs to make it easy for users to share data from their devices with developers.&#x20;
3. Build tooling that makes device data more accessible to developers so they can create new user experiences using the open & neutral DIMO platform and economy.

Development will be undertaken in phases, unlocking new capabilities, classes of devices to connect, and levels of decentralization at each step.
