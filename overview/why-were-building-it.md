# Why we're building it

The walled gardens of the Web 2.0 era have been reproduced in the physical world through IoT networks like Google Home, Facebook Portal, and Alexa.

Vehicles are the next and largest category of devices to be connected. Automakers have created companies like [Otonomo](https://otonomo.io) and [Wejo](https://www.wejo.com) to replicate the Web2 model of reselling user data, while Amazon, Google, and Apple are doing everything they can to embed their software into vehicles.

This model has proven it delivers value to corporations first and users second (if at all). Instead of a rich ecosystem of transparent and composable applications, we have silos that can’t interact without brittle, rent-seeking intermediaries. [Violations](https://chicago.suntimes.com/2021/6/13/22528743/amazon-sidewalk-privacy-hacking-echo-ring-doorball-editorial) of [privacy](https://www.wejo.com/press/wejo-palantir), [security](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/kia-motors-america-suffers-ransomware-attack-20-million-ransom/), and interoperability guarantees show that incentives are not aligned between equipment manufacturers (OEMs), regulators, and the public.

Freedom of mobility will be compromised if autonomous and electric vehicles are deployed at scale using this outdated model. Fortunately there is a better way.

An entire generation of people have now grown up with tech like Bitcoin & Ethereum—everything is open by default, the rules of the system are public, and anyone can get involved without asking a corporation for permission.

**Now that these Web3 technologies and communities have matured to the point where they’re controlling trillions of dollars in purely digital assets, it’s time to plug them into the physical world.**

Massive amounts of digital innovation are put towards making virtual or fictional worlds better - the “metaverse” is the buzzword of the day. **Our mission is to improve the real world by building a foundation for open cyber-physical systems.**

We call it the trusted machine age, and in this future:

:calling:Users own & delegate access to connected devices, so they work for their owners, not the companies that built them;

:woman\_technologist:Developers can build apps and services that compete on their merits, not on access to gated distribution channels;

:classical\_building:Privacy and regulatory oversight can coexist under transparent rules; and&#x20;

:construction\_site:The physical and digital public goods that support modern connected devices can be properly funded.
