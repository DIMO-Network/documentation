### Support the Projectâ€”Contribute to DIMO

DIMO is a decentralized, community-owned protocol which means there are plenty of opportunities for you as a community member to get involved. In fact we think DIMO can only work with you involved. _This means you can contribute your expertise and work across all the projects DIMO is working on._

DIMO is structured in hybrid dTeams which include both DIMO Core Team members and community members who are working to make the vision a success. You can learn more about current \[d]Teams [<mark style="color:blue;">**here**</mark>](../governance/d-teams.md)**.**&#x20;

For a **** general overview of DIMO and how to contribute you can visit the **DIMO Contributor Atlas** which will help orient you as a visitor (and soon to be citizen) of DIMO City.
