### Support the Project—Contribute to DIMO

DIMO is a decentralized, community-owned protocol which means there are plenty of opportunities for you as a community member to get involved. In fact we think DIMO can only work with you involved. _This means you can contribute your expertise and work across all the projects DIMO is working on._

DIMO is structured in hybrid dTeams which include both DIMO Core Team members and community members who are working to make the vision a success. You can learn more about current \[d]Teams [**here**](../governance/d-teams.md)**.** In the expandable sections below you can continue your journey:

* Contribute code to other native apps in the DIMO ecosystem.
* Build 3rd party apps that use DIMO data or offer services to DIMO users. [**Get in touch here**](https://dimo.zone/developers/).
