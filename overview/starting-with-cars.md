description: Our initial focus is on connecting as many vehicles to DIMO as possible.

# Starting with cars

Amazon famously sold books before expanding to music, hardware, and cloud services.&#x20;

By focusing on a specific IoT device category, the core DIMO team will be able to deliver a platform that wins consumer, developer, and enterprise support using our limited resources. Our plan is to generalize the number of devices (and applications) that DIMO supports as we progressively scale and decentralize the protocol.&#x20;

We selected the connected car category using  this simple formula:&#x20;

ðŸ“¶ Coverage  X  âœ… Quality  X  ðŸ“ˆ Demand  =  ðŸ“Š DIMO Total Value

#### ðŸ“¶ Coverage

How many \[devices] can you connect & how much data do they produce? There are 275 million cars in the US alone, and cars produce the most data of any consumer device: [1500x more data per minute](https://www.statista.com/chart/8018/connected-car-data-generation/) than web browsing. Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS), and vehicle electrification will massively expand the volume of vehicle data as these technologies mature in the next decade.

#### âœ… Quality

How reliably can you source data & at what intervals? Vehicle data is open & accessible (if you know where to look). Legislation like [Right to Repair](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motor\_Vehicle\_Owners'\_Right\_to\_Repair\_Act) and car hacker communities like [OpenDBC](https://github.com/commaai/opendbc) have paved the way for any vehicle owner to plug in a device that records and transmits the information from their car in a usable format while they drive.

#### ðŸ“ˆ Demand

Who cares & how much? What additional analysis do they require? OEMs have committed to [aggressive](https://www.caranddriver.com/news/g35562831/ev-plans-automakers-timeline/) investments in [production](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/29/global-electric-vehicle-numbers-set-to-hit-145-million-by-2030-iea-.html#:\~:text=The%20number%20of%20electric%20cars,Energy%20Agency%20said%20on%20Thursday.\&text=In%20the%20first%20quarter%20of,the%20same%20period%20in%202020.) and R\&D to electrify & automate vehicles within 10 years. [Batteries](https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/29/22357068/hyundai-kona-ev-recall-battery-fire-nhtsa) and [ADAS systems](https://www.nhtsa.gov/press-releases/nhtsa-orders-crash-reporting-vehicles-equipped-advanced-driver-assistance-systems) in particular have huge potential liability exposures which can be limited with better data, as information about their real-world performance is inadequately distributed back through the supply chain.

#### ðŸ“ŠDIMO Total Value Connected

The extended market of transactions based on EV data DIMO can collect and validate is large and growing fast. It includes insurance, maintenance, financing, used car sales, fleet operations, charging infrastructure, and [more](https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/automotive-and-assembly/our-insights/unlocking-the-full-life-cycle-value-from-connected-car-data#:\~:text=capture%20full%20value.-,Exhibit%202,-We%20strive%20to).

Vehicle owners are not currently included in the monetization of this data. Companies like [Wejo](https://www.wejo.com) and [Otonomo](https://otonomo.io) are purchasing data from automakers (OEMs) unbeknownst to end users, turning cars into Facebook accounts that canâ€™t be deleted. This OEM-controlled structure also reduces the availability, reliability, and neutrality of these data products, creating an unfriendly environment for developers who can generate additional value for connected vehicle owners.
