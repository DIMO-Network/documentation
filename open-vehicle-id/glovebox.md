# Glovebox

### What can I add to the glovebox?

Once you have added your vehicle to the DIMO mobile app (no connection required) you are able to add the following documents to your vehicle

* Title
* Registration
* Insurance
* Vehicles maintenance history

To access the glovebox feature - on your home screen, click on the three dots in the upper right hand corner and select Glovebox.&#x20;

To add any of these items, you must take a photo or upload the document from your camera roll. You can currently add in multiple photos.&#x20;
