# General FAQs

### What is DIMO?&#x20;

DIMO is an open software platform that allows drivers to stream their vehicle data in exchange for tokens—practically employing Web3 technology to build a user-owned network that maximizes the value of IoT data and functionality while minimizing privacy and systemic risks.

Today, DIMO provides a way for people to collect, custody, and share data from vehicles, built on a framework that enables participants to earn ownership of the network proportional to the value they create.

We are building the foundation for a developer ecosystem that will enable next-generation mobility applications for connected vehicles, which we believe is necessary to scale the deployment of key technologies like zero-emission and automated vehicles.

### What can I do with DIMO as a driver?

Today you can connect your car and stream verified data. Very soon, you'll also be able to earn $DIMO tokens. You can access a growing library of applications and services built on DIMO. Today, this is a limited set of data storage and “read-only” vehicle information apps developed by the core team.

### How can I connect today?

Go to [app.dimo.zone](https://app.dimo.zone) to create an account and connect your car(s).

### How can I build apps for cars and drivers?

The core team is developing an extensive DIMO Grants Program that will allow developers to earn significant $DIMO in exchange for building key applications on the platform.

Apps are set up as “data consumers” that can pull data from the protocol to learn about the performance of components like batteries, automated driving systems, and controls. This will enable the development of disruptive new applications for fine-grained insurance, ride hailing, traffic navigation, vehicle financing, energy grid optimization, and much more.&#x20;

### When will hardware ship?&#x20;

Check [hardware-ecosystem.md](../../development-roadmap/hardware-ecosystem.md "mention") for the latest information.&#x20;

### When did DIMO start?

After a year of R\&D we launched the DIMO Alpha Fleet in late 2021 and are ready to begin onboarding thousands of users in early 2022. If you’re here now, you’re early!&#x20;

### How do I learn more?

You're already in the best place to read the overview. You can also visit [our blog](https://medium.com/dimo-network) and [join our discord](http://chat.dimo.zone). We also post regularly on twitter [@dimo\_network](https://twitter.com/DIMO\_Network) and update [open-source repos on Github](https://github.com/DIMO-INC).&#x20;

### Who is building this and Why?

DIMO grew out of a product studio and IoT consulting firm called Digital Infrastructure Services in 2020. Our project is heavily inspired by [Helium](https://www.helium.com), which demonstrated that token incentives are a capital efficient way to build supply in real-world user-owned IoT networks.

The full-time core team is made up of 8 engineers with deep mobility, web3 and IoT experience as well as 3 non-technical contributors that split responsibilities associated with go-to-market, organizational design, finance, strategy, marketing, governance, and partnerships.

Throughout the project formation phase, the core team has worked with dozens of individuals and organizations as advisors to guide technical and strategic decisions, capital partners to provide seed funding, beta testers to provide data and product feedback, and 3rd party developers to build non-core product and platform software. As we add significant new contributors to the project [we’ll list them on this page](https://dimo.zone/team/).

We’re on a mission to fulfill DIMO’s mission to advance how devices help people connect with and move throughout the world.&#x20;

### Is DIMO just for new or electric vehicles?

No! DIMO can be useful for any vehicle that provides data. You can think of a vehicle in DIMO as a single entity that can have multiple different streams of data attached to it from a number of different sources.

Modern cars typically produce more data and have additional sensors built in, so you may be able to provide more value to the DIMO network (and earn additional rewards) with these vehicles.

### What are the different ways I can connect my car to DIMO?

Initially, DIMO will offer a few ways for drivers to connect their cars.

The first is via their automaker's connectd car subscription. DIMO uses [Smartcar](https://smartcar.com), a handy interface that allows anyone who already has an app for their car to use those same credentials to connect to DIMO. It’s like Plaid, but for your car. By signing up and adding your vehicle, we can automatically tell you if you will be able to connect with SmartCar.

We’re also releasing the very first version of a [DIMO hardware](https://shop.dimo.zone/password), a miner like a Helium hotspot that allows you to stream data from your car by plugging it into your car’s standard data port, the OBD2 port. This is the same port used by insurance plug-in devices or diagnostic tools. The device was made in partnership with [AutoPi](http://www.autopi.io) and it delivers far more data and also earns drivers higher rewards.

### What cars are compatible with DIMO?

Almost any car manufactured in the past ten years (2012 or newer) registered in the US and Canada will be compatible. We're starting in this region for a combination of technical and legal reasons. We hope to expand to Mexico and Europe later in 2022, followed by the rest of the world. While we may not be in your country yet, you can still earn tokens by referring new drivers (create an account at [https://app.dimo.zone/](https://app.dimo.zone) to generate a referral link) and contributing to the DAO.\

We're working on expanding support, but with older cars, the challenge is getting viable data off of the car. This can inhibit token rewards or doing useful things with that data, like building next-generation apps.

### Why don't older cars work if they have an OBD2 Port?

There are two reasons why older cars are not supported today:

1. More modern cars have greater telemetry available from subsystems, meaning there is more data to collect. The volume of data is a key consideration in the value of the connected data.
2. Every car has data encoded differently. OBD2 ports are not like USB ports where they work the same way on every machine. Since each model of vehicle needs to be decoded separately, complexity expands with every vehicle.&#x20;

DIMO has ongoing efforts to decode more vehicles and expand the number of vehicles we can connect. We also have limited hardware supply and wanted to ensure maximum impact. We'll revisit this policy later this year, but can't promise anything yet.
