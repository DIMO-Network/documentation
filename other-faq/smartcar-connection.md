# SmartCar Connection

### Help! My Vehicle Won't Connect Via SmartCar!? &#x20;

Make sure you’re signed up for your automaker’s connected vehicle services. A software connection to DIMO requires you to have an active subscription to your automaker’s connected vehicle services product to see data. Depending on the automaker, these services may be free or require a monthly subscription.&#x20;

****[**This guide**](https://www.notion.so/Brand-Subscription-Information-751db7c79b8348b293ef12d4c6b9c982) **will tell you what subscription you need to have depending on your vehicle.**

### Is your connected vehicle services subscription active?

Your subscription through your automaker may have become inactive or need to be re-synced. This may have happened for many reasons, including a change in your billing information. Many automakers offer their services for free for some time before requiring customers to pay. Check to see if data from your vehicle appears in your automaker’s app. If you’re also not seeing data in your automaker’s app, there’s likely an issue on your automaker’s side.

### Have your login credentials with your automaker changed?&#x20;

Your vehicle may have become disconnected from DIMO if you’ve changed your password with your automaker. If so just reconnect your vehicle in DIMO, and you’ll be good to go. You’ll still see all your old data. Start your car if you’ve just connected or if it’s been off for a long period of time. It’s normal if you don’t immediately see data from your vehicle after connecting it. For many automakers like Teslas, starting your vehicle after connecting can help you see data more quickly.&#x20;

### What happens if my car has been offline for a while?

If you’re no longer seeing data from your connected vehicle and it’s been off for an extended period of time, this doesn’t necessarily mean there’s a connection issue. The vehicle may be offline in a deep sleep and not actively send any data.&#x20;

* Try starting the vehicle to bring it back online and see if data appears over the next couple of hours.&#x20;
* If none of the above works, disconnect (don’t delete) the vehicle from DIMO and reconnect it. You’ll still see your historical data.

### Before contacting DIMO support, please take these steps:&#x20;

Try checking any other connected vehicles you may have on DIMO. If you do not see any data from them either, there may be an account-level issue.&#x20;

* If you’re using the DIMO mobile app, make sure you’re updated to the latest version. Check your device’s app store to see if an update may be available.&#x20;
* If you’re using DIMO on the web and have taken the steps above, try clearing your browser’s cache.&#x20;
