# Hardware Ecosystem

The Digital Infrastructure Inc and AutoPi teams are working as hard as possible to meet this timeline for shipping hardware from presales, and opening up additional supply for users.&#x20;

We'll update this page and our customers as scheduling changes are made.&#x20;

On March 4th the team announced a clarification to the process by which hardware rewards are calculated.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
For users who preordered a device: _We are going to treat **the date a user ordered** their DIMO Data Miner as the date their rewards begin (as long as they plug in and stay connected for 3 months)._ This will give hardware and distribution teams the ability deliver the best quality product on time, and our earliest supporters won't miss out.
{% endhint %}

![As always, these plans are subject to change. ](<../.gitbook/assets/image (10).png>)

Echo Fleet refers to "Ecosystem" hardware. These devices will follow a spec set by the DIMO Hardware team, and will be announced along with results from testing and validation steps.&#x20;
