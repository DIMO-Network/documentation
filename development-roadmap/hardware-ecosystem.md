The Digital Infrastructure Inc and AutoPi teams are working as hard as possible to meet this timeline for shipping hardware, and opening up additional supply.&#x20;

We'll update this page and our customers as scheduling changes are made.&#x20;

Echo Fleet refers to "Ecosystem" hardware. These devices will follow a spec set by the DIMO/AutoPi teams and&#x20;
