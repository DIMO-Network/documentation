# Phase 1.0

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/phase 1.png>)

\~1.3 million Tesla vehicles and 15 million more cars from other Auto Manufacturers have some form of open API. Due to the cost of sending data over the air, this provides a lower quantity/quality of data, but it is easy to integrate at scale and will allow DIMO to build out polling, storage, and vehicle ID protocol.

During onboarding, the user will provide login credentials that grant DIMO access to collect certain vehicle data by calling an OEM API. A user can then store this information locally, or delegate permission for DIMO to store in an IPFS cluster or Arweave.

Security In the case of existing data provided via API/MQTT/Kafka from OEM APIs, we will leverage DNS and Certificates Trust Chain to validate the data source.

The following smart contracts will be deployed to testnet during Phase 1.0:
