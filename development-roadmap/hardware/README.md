# Hardware

The Digital Infrastructure Inc and AutoPi teams are working as hard as possible to meet this timeline for shipping hardware from presales, and opening up additional supply for users.&#x20;

On March 4th the team announced a clarification to the process by which hardware rewards are calculated.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
For users who preordered a device: _We are going to treat **the date a user ordered** their DIMO Data Miner as the date their rewards begin (as long as they plug in and stay connected for 3 months)._ This will give hardware and distribution teams the ability deliver the best quality product on time, and our earliest supporters won't miss out.
{% endhint %}

If you'd like to build a hardware device in the DIMO ecosystem, please [reach out via this form. ](https://forms.gle/8BMFijTzVoGycGnZ9)
