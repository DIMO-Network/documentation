# AutoPi DIMO Miner V1

UPDATE 3/31/22 - We have updated our shipping timeline located in the graphs below. We have decided to delay our shipping table by 1 month at the most. This was due to the 300 first devices having a ATECC108A chip, and future devices, including any manufactured by 3rd party manufacturers, will have a NXP SE050 chip (our secure element).

We are expecting to work past this issue and getting back on track to our original schedule! we are still planning on shipping all Alpha Fleet orders by June/July



UPDATE 5/20/2022 - Covid lockdowns in China pushed us back a few weeks, but we thought we might still get a good chunk of devices out in May. However, earlier this week one of the components on the circuit board failed testing. That means that instead of giving the green light to produce and receive 2,500 units in two weeks, we now have to swap out the component, produce another small batch, and test those units for a few weeks.

It should be an easy fix. Alternatives to that component are easy to get and we don’t expect other setbacks. However, hardware projects are a bit less predictable and harder to control so we want to start being more humble and realistic —additional delays are still possible. While with most projects we’d make no excuses and work around the clock to get it done, hardware projects simply have more variables that are out of your control. No amount of pushing on our end can make the next revision come faster.

Despite how it may seem, the effects are largely positive for customers. On the one hand, more time will pass before you get to hold that sleek device in your hand and take control of your car data. On the other, you’re already part of the movement and you’re already earning.
