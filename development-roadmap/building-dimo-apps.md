# Building DIMO Apps

There are many applications that can be built using a decentralized and user-owned IoT platform.

In Phase 1, DIMO is focused on making it easy for developers to build these applications.

We‚Äôre accomplishing this by seeding and supporting independent teams with proven track records, and providing them with clean interfaces to the DIMO platform.

Examples of application categories which make use of ‚Äúread-only‚Äù connections to DIMO vehicles are provided below.&#x20;

|       <p><span data-gb-custom-inline data-tag="emoji" data-code="1f50b">üîã</span></p><p>Battery Intelligence</p>      | Realtime ground-truth data on battery performance | Hundreds of billions of dollars are being spent by automakers, battery OEMs, VCs, and others to improve and develop EV batteries. The [entire industry is betting on batteries](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/16/business/energy-environment/electric-car-batteries-investment.html) yet real-world performance data is nearly impossible to come by.                                                    |

| <p><span data-gb-custom-inline data-tag="emoji" data-code="1f4b3">üí≥</span></p><p>Vehicle Commerce &#x26; Finance</p> | Vehicle value can and should be data-driven       | Car purchases and financing depend on the health and use history of a vehicle. DIMO provides neutral, comprehensive, and authenticated vehicle usage data and identity, which opens up new possibilities.                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
|         <p><span data-gb-custom-inline data-tag="emoji" data-code="1f98e">ü¶é</span></p><p>Smart Insurance</p>         | Let‚Äôs fix data-driven car insurance               | Insurance companies have built driver monitoring black boxes that obscure calculations and can even incentivize unsafe driving. With DIMO you can build open, transparent insurance products that provide drivers their own copy of vehicle data to properly protect themselves in security and liability incidents. As AVs enter the world, insurance that uses data from ADAS systems will be necessary. |
|    <p><span data-gb-custom-inline data-tag="emoji" data-code="26a1">‚ö°</span></p><p>Energy Utility Integrations</p>    | Let‚Äôs get the electric grid ready for EVs         | Utilities can reward users by incentivizing charging behaviors based on local market conditions. DIMO hardware (and certain API connections) can provide this solution, by turning vehicles (and chargers) into [DERs.](https://blog.aee.net/distributed-energy-resources-101-required-reading-for-a-modern-grid)                                                                                          |

Additional grants and support to teams will be provided as vehicle supply increases, additional functionality is unlocked, and the $DIMO token is in the hands of users who can signal their desire for specific functionality.

If you are a developer who is interested in building an app on DIMO you can apply for a [license and/or grant](https://dimo.zone/developers/) here.&#x20;
