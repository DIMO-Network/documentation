# Seeding applications

Before getting into the detailed roadmap, it‚Äôs helpful to imagine the applications that can be built using a decentralized and user-owned automotive IoT platform.

In Phase 1, DIMO is focused on making it easy for developers to build these applications.

We‚Äôre accomplishing this in a scalable way by seeding and supporting independent teams with proven track records, and providing them with clean interfaces to the DIMO platform.

Examples of funded applications which make use of ‚Äúread-only‚Äù connections to DIMO vehicles are provided below. Additional grants and support to teams will be provided as vehicle supply increases, additional functionality is unlocked, and the $DIMO token is in the hands of users who can signal their desire for specific functionality.

The [entire industry is betting on batteries](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/16/business/energy-environment/electric-car-batteries-investment.html) yet real-world performance data is nearly impossible to come by.                                                                                                         |

With the rise of electric vehicles, where the residual value of a car is mainly determined by the health of the battery, this neutral, comprehensive, and authenticated vehicle usage and state data is more important than ever.                                                                                                                                 |

With DIMO you can build open, transparent insurance products that users can audit themselves and provide drivers their own copy of vehicle data to properly protect themselves in security and liability incidents. As AVs enter the world, insurance that uses data from specific ADAS systems and vehicles will be necessary. |

Utilities can reward users by incentivizing charging behaviors based on local market conditions.
